                Welcome to my gallery! This page is mostly just a bunch of pictures of me or taken by me. Most of these pictures are either from a significant event, or represent something that I have done with my life that I really enjoy. Others are pictures of things I have been working on, and some are just photos I've taken that I really like. Enjoy!

                        This is the cap that I wore for graduation at Mount Holyoke College. The top has all of the planets of the solar system (yes I included Pluto), and the bottom has a bunch of fake daisies glued to it to represent my ultimate frisbee team, "Daisy Chain".

                        This is a photo that was taken of me at a tournament during the Spring 2018 ultimate frisbee season. This was my first semester as a captain. In this photo I had just come off the field after playing a few points in a game. It's a much more flattering picture than any taken of me actually playing.

                        This is a low-quality photo I took of the cover slide on Spencer Smith's presentation at the APS Division of Fluid Dynamics Conference. I took this photo at the presentation just before it started. Professor Smith's presentation, like my poster, was titled "Fractal Measures in Paper Marbling". At the conference, he gave a lecture on the project we worked on over the summer in 2018, and I created and presented a poster on it.

                        This is a photo of the Mercedes Benz stadium that I took on my last day at the DFD conference. The event was located at the Georgia World Congress Center which was very close by to the stadium. As a football fan I was very excited to see this gorgeous stadium in person, especially since it was the home of the Super Bowl that season.

                        This is a photo that my team and I took after our very last game at the DIII Women's National Championships in Rockford, IL. We were very proud to have finished the tournament in fifth place. This tournament marked the end of our Spring 2018 season, and my first season as a captain. I'm found standing next to my coach, wearing the egg costume.

We were very proud to be the champions of this tournament and win $500 from it, all of which went towards funding future tournaments. This tournament was challenging, but also very fun and taught us a lot about how heavily this sport relies on mental toughness.

After doing well at this tournament, we moved on to Regionals and then made Nationals for the fourth year in a row. I'm so proud of my team for all that we have accomplished, and it has been an honor to play my favorite sport with them.

Mountain Day is a tradition at Mount Holyoke where on a random day early in the Fall Semester, all classes are cancelled so everyone has the opportunity to hike up Skinner Mountain.

                        This is a picture I took of the first collection of marbling images I created with Professor Spencer Smith when we conducted the experiments on marbling. The images at the very top were created using a bath with the highest viscosity and the ones at the bottom used a bath with the lowest viscosity. Meanwhile the ones on the left had the fewest comb drags and the ones on the right had the most.
