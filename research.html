                Welcome to my research page! Here you will find information on research projects that I've participated in, including finished papers and posters. So far I have participated in two different labs at my undergraduate institution and completed an independent project in each of them. Here you will find descriptions of my experiences in these labs, and both of the research posters I created.

                    During the summer of 2018, I completed my second research project as an undergraduate at Mount Holyoke College. Throughout this time I worked with Professor Spencer Smith in his lab at Mount Holyoke where we used mathematical and computational methods to explore the behavior of fluid systems. There are a few different projects that are conducted in his lab, which I spent some time exploring during the Spring 2018 semester before beginning my project over the summer.

                    During the Spring 2018 semester, I also took a course taught by Professor Smith titled "Themes in Physics and Art". In this course we explored the intersection between physics and art by examining the role that physics plays in artistic media and composition, as well as discussing how physics can be an inspiration for art. For one of the units of this course, we studied the art of paper marbling, and how this particular artisitc medium is highly dictated by physics, particularly fluid dynamics. During this unit, Spencer invided a couple of professional paper marblers who have a studio in Amherst MA to come in to our class and give a demonstration on paper marbling. Everyone in the class was fascinated by the process of paper marbling, as well as the beautiful patterns that emerged from it.

                <p>
                    Feeling inspired by this course, I decided that I'd like to use my time during the summer to study the intersection between physics and art more in depth. After discussing this with Spencer, he came to me with the perfect project to meet this goal: the paper marblers who gave the demo for our class showed an interest in working with us to study the physics behind the art of paper marbling, and would allow us to study the physics behind the art of paper marbling, and would allow us to come in to their studio to conduct experiments. This proposal was really exciting to me, so I agreed to participate in this project. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While taking the physics and art course, I also developed an interest in fractals. When observing the images created from paper marbling I noticed that they appear to have similar properties to some fractal images, particularly those that exhibit self-repeating patterns. This inspired me to incorporate fractals in to my study and analyze the marbling images by determining if they have any fractal propertes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout the summer, Spencer and I worked on developing a program that analyzed the fractal properties of an image, particularly the fractal dimension, that would be used on the images we create from paper marbling. Additionally, we spent two days in the paper marbling studio creating images by experimenting with the viscosity of the solution the paints are dripped on to, and the number of times we dragged the comb through the paints. The result was a collection of beautiful marbling images, most of which we ran through the program that was written to analyze them. The result from our analysis of the images was the conclusion that the images created from paper marbling have fractal properties to them. 
                </p>

                    To present these findings, I created a research poster which I presented at the Mount Holyoke College SPS Summer Research Poster Session in September 2018. This project also led me to the APS Division of Fluid Dynamics Conference which took place in Atlanta Georgia in November 2018. At this conference I presented my poster at the technical poster session, and attended some talks on various applications of fluid dynamics. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have shared this poster below, which goes over some background information on paper marbling and fractals, then discusses the theory behind the project, which was inspired by a paper cited in the poster. It also outlines the processes we used to create the marbling images, and analyze the images using a program written in Python. Finally, it discusses the results of the projects as well as possibilities for future work.
