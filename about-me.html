                            My name is Michelle Wellman and I am currently working as a lab assistant in a neutrino detector lab at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. I recently graduated from Mount Holyoke College with a bachelor's degree in physics and astronomy in May 2019. Currently, my big goal is to become a PhD candidate in physics in Fall 2021. After getting a PhD I hope to become a physics professor so I can conduct my own research as well as educate the next generation of physicists. Outside of physics, one thing I like to do in my spare time is play ultimate frisbee. While I was in undergrad, I played on Mount Holyoke's women's club team all four years, and served as a captain during my last three semesters. Some of my other hobbies include making art, cooking, playing with dogs, rollerblading, and hiking.

                            This past year I have been working full time in the Pocar lab as a research assistant where I have been focusing running computer simulations written in Python, as well as performing analyses on the data taken during experiments. Starting September 2020, I have been continuing to work part time in the lab, and spending a lot of time working on graduate school applications. My goal is to start a graduate program in physics in Fall 2021.

                            This is my personal website which is home to my personal blog where I write about things in physics, math and programming that I've been learning as well as other things that interest me. My research page provides details on my research experiences and electronic copies of my completed work in these labs including posters and papers. My projects page contains descriptions and electronic copies of projects I have completed in and out of classes.
