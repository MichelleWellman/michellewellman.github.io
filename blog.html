                        Hello everyone, and welcome to the first blog post on my brand-new website! To start off, let me tell you a little bit about myself: my name is Michelle Wellman, and I am a recent graduate from Mount Holyoke College with a double major in physics and astronomy. The next step forward for me with this bachelor’s degree is to get into a program where I can pursue a PhD in physics or astrophysics. With a PhD, I hope to become a physics professor. Outside of physics, one thing I like to do in my spare time is play ultimate frisbee. While I was in college, I played on Mount Holyoke’s women’s club team all four years, and even served as a captain during my last three semesters. Additionally, I served on the board for Mount Holyoke’s Society of Physics Students chapter as the social chair and then as the Vice President. Some of my other hobbies and activities include art, cooking, playing with my dog, and watching football.

                        The next year or two are going to be “gap years” for me, where I will be taking a break from being a full-time student, exploring my interests, and working on strengthening my applications for grad school. Starting in the Fall I will be taking one course per semester in order to further my education in physics, and to strengthen my case for my readiness to begin a PhD. Additionally, I have been applying to different kinds of jobs that I can do in the meantime (I’ll probably share more on this process in a later post).

                        This is my personal website, and there are four major components to it: my blog, details on my research experiences, a portfolio showing some of my best work, and a photo gallery. This is the first post of my blog, which consists of posts on my experiences as a physics student, my thoughts on science or other things that interest me, as well as some miscellaneous stuff that I’ve been working on, or wish to share.
