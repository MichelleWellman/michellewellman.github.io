                Welcome to my gallery! This page is mostly just a bunch of pictures of me or taken by me. Most of these pictures are either from a significant event, or represent something that I have done with my life that I really enjoy. Others are pictures of things I have been working on, and some are just photos I've taken that I really like. Enjoy!

                        This is the cap that I wore for graduation at Mount Holyoke College. The top has all of the planets of the solar system (yes I included Pluto), and the bottom has a bunch of fake daisies glued to it to represent my ultimate frisbee team, "Daisy Chain".

                        This is the photo me and most of my physics friends took together at Mount Holyoke's "101 days until graduation event". I'm pictured here with most of the physics majors from the MHC class of 2019.

                        This is a photo that was taken of me at a tournament during the Spring 2018 ultimate frisbee season. This was my first semester as a captain. In this photo I had just come off the field after playing a few points in a game. It's a much more flattering picture than any taken of me actually playing.

                        This is a low-quality photo I took of the cover slide on Spencer Smith's presentation at the APS Division of Fluid Dynamics Conference. I took this photo at the presentation just before it started. Professor Smith's presentation, like my poster, was titled "Fractal Measures in Paper Marbling". At the conference, he gave a lecture on the project we worked on over the summer in 2018, and I created and presented a poster on it.

                        This is a photo of the Mercedes Benz stadium that I took on my last day at the DFD conference. The event was located at the Georgia World Congress Center which was very close by to the stadium. As a football fan I was very excited to see this gorgeous stadium in person, especially since it was the home of the Super Bowl that season.
