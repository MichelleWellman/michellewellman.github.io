                    Throughout the summer of 2017 I had my first experience participating in research in a physics lab. That summer I worked with Professor Alexi Arango in his lab at Mount Holyoke College, where we attempt to create devices that generate electricity using solar energy. The ultimate goal of this lab is to construct efficient tandem cells, which would lead to large-area, lightweight, flexible solar cells. Conducting research in this lab was a lot of fun and an excellent first experience in a physics lab. It was also very rewarding since it contributes to the increasingly important task of eliminating greenhouse gas emissions.

                    The summer I was working there we focused on experimenting with lead-sulfide (PbS) quantum dots as an absorption layer for the devices we constructed. Quantum dots are basically very small semiconductor particles that are only several nanometers in diameter. Lead-sulfide quantum dots are an attractive material for creating solar cells because they have a low fabrication cost. Throughout the summer, I worked with a few other students to familiarize ourselves with the process of creating PbS quantum dot solar cells by taking part in experiments on each of the different steps in fabricating them, collecting data on absorption, open-circuit voltage and efficiency, and understanding what the data we collected was telling us about these devices. By the end of the summer, all of us had chosen a part of the fabrication process of these solar cells to conduct our own experiment on and present our findings in a poster.

                    The part of the process I chose to focus on was th ligand exchange treatment for the PbS absorption layer of the cells. The goal of my experiment was to try out a different chemical for the ligand exchange treatment than the one we had been using for most of the summer.

                <p>
                    The poster I have shared below begins by providing details on the role that the ligand exchange treatment plays in the function of the solar cell. It then presents the purpose of conducting this experiment, the process of the experiment, and the results. Finally, it discusses the possibilities for future experiments. I presented this poster at the Mount Holyoke College SPS Summer Research Poster Session in October 2017.
