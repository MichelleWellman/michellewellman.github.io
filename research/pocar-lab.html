                <p class="card-text">
                    Since August 2019 I have been working as a lab assistant in the Pocar Lab at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The Pocar Lab is a neutrino detector lab that works on detecting weakly interacting particles such as neutrinos and dark matter. My role in the lab mostly consists of working with a computer to run simulations for the Liquid Xenon System Experiment. I am very happy working here, it's challenging and interesting, and I'm really glad that I get to think about physics everyday for a living.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong> What We Do in the Lab </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the overall goals of the lab is to detect a neutrinoless double beta decay. Currently this is only a theoretical process of elementary particles, however detection of this process would require changes to the current setup of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. The Liquid Xenon System experiment contributes to this goal by testing detectors that could be used to find a neutrinoless double beta decay.

                <p>
                    <strong> My Role in the Lab </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The task I have been given in the lab is to run simulations of the setup for the Liquid Xenon System and analyze the results. I spend a lot of my time programming which I have been really enjoying and learning a lot about. I also spend some time reading, doing research, and learning about the physics relevant to my work as well as learning about programming in Python. The program that I run simulates photons starting at a point source, traveling through a cell filled with Liquid Xenon, and finally hitting a detector. This is only part of the process that occurs in the experiment conducted in real life, however it's an important part of the process because a neutrinoless double beta decay would be found by a detector absorbing photons.

                    <strong> Exciting Stuff to Come </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently I have been running experiments with the simulation in order to find information about the optical and surface parameters of the materials we use in the setup. So far, I have been conducting an investigation on the refractive indices of the two main materials the photons travel through, and soon I'm going to be looking at the reflectivity of another material we are using. I expect to be completing a write up on the refractive index tests in the very near future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, this research position has given me a whole new set of challenges, including realizing all of the gaps I still have in my knowledge despite having a degree in physics. I have had to learn a lot of new stuff including coding in Python, writing Bash scripts, as well as reviewing things I have already learned such as optics. The good news is that this gives me an opportunity to share what I have learned on my blog and my notes page.
